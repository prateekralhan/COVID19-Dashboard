# COVID19-Dashboard

With the sudden upsurge of COVID19 across the planet, I implemented a Simple Minimalistic Dashboard using PowerBI for getting a holistic view of the current state COVID19 across different countries. 

## Data Source: 
The data source for the Dasboard has been taken from [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).

## Installation and Usage:
1. You must have PowerBI installed and set up in your system in order to view the dashboard in your system. Download the Free version of [PowerBI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) and sign up for the PowerBI account in case you want to publish your reports on the web, embed them in your website(s), share with others etc.

__Note: Personal Email IDs won't be accepted for creating an account. Use your institutional/organizational Email ID to sign up and create a PowerBI account. I used my University E-mail ID here.__

2. Download the PowerBI report (**with .pbix extension**) and open it with PowerBI.
3. Here the data source settings have already been setup. Just click on **Refresh** in order to refresh the dashboard and get the latest data.
4. Play around with the report, add/remove filter(s), try to add more visualisations and make it more interesting!!
5. Click on the **Publish** icon present above to publish the PowerBI report on Web which can be later shared with anyone.
6. I already have the Dashboard published on web as well but it cannot be shared as I am using the free version :expressionless: .

## Typical View of the Dashboard:
1. You can also access the live Dashboard by scanning this QR Code:
